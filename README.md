# Flutter Gemini AI Game Show Host

Let's integrate with Gemini using the new package Google just released. 

Rather than the example file's StatefulWidget implementation, we'll use Riverpod + Freezed to structure the project better. And we'll sprinkle in a little fun by giving our AI the personality of a gameshow host.
