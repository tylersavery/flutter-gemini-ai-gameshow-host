# Flutter Gemini AI Game Show Host

Let's creating an integration with Gemini using the new package google just released. Rather than the example file's StatefulWidget implementation, we'll use Riverpod + Freezed and structure the project a little better. And, we'll sprinkle in a little fun by giving our AI the personality of a gameshow host.
